# dArchive
A universal website and media archiver, follows links for css and detects websites with specific archive methods


WIP:
Initial Plans:
Get external resources saved and accessed from within the downloaded site
Have a GUI that shows archive history, current ongoing archives and archives running (archive here represents both the constant loop of saving a page and the save itself)
Have archivers for specific sites like youtube, discord and others.
